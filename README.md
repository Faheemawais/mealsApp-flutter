# meals_app

This is my second Flutter Project that is based on multiple Screens.

## Working

This project has a lot of core logic of using routes for transfering the from one screen to other using push and pop methods.
Many new Widgets are used like InkWell, Grid, BottomNavigationBarItem, Drawer etc.
A lot of work behind like state management.
